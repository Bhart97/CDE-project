## Project name: CDE Project

**Introduction**: This group-based project will demostrate the student's understanding of cloud technology and engineering in preparation for their assignment in health IT. Students will collaborate with their team members and gain additional insight into software development and deployment.

**Description**: Students will host a web application on the cloud and keeping a consideration on these core components: cloud computing, storage and database management, virtual networks, security, and cost analysis.

**Constraints**: Project will be completed using free-tier / low-cost services on AWS and will leverage open-source programs to complete this project. Assumes basic knowledge from technical track including command-line tools, Python, and SQL. Since this project is limited by technical skills, project scope is expected as students become more familiar with the cloud and want to explore additional topics.

**Goals**: 
- Create and successfully run a Python script.
- Launch and configure EC2 instances and MySQL database.
- Create a VPC that allows communication between two subnets.
- Host and connect to a web application from the public IP address.
- Use serverless functions to automatically notify of changes to the application.
- Identify potential issues and troubleshoot your deployment.
- Diagnose and analyze the metrics of running applications on the cloud.

**Milestones:**
- Module a - completing their first program
- Module b - successfully host an application on the cloud
- Module c - maintaining and automating their application

**Deliverables:**
- Functional, interactive web database that contains OCP's cohort information and allows for queries by the end of 2021.

**TODO:**
