## Project name: CDE Project

**Introduction**: This project will showcase the student's understanding of cloud technology and engineering in preparation for their assignment in health IT. Students will be able to collaborate with their team members and gain additional insight into software development and deployment.

**Description**: Students will demostrate their understanding of these core components: identity and access management, computing services, networking, security, and service analysis. By the end of this project, students will have successfully host a web server as well as maintain a database.

**Constraints**: Completing the project will require basic knowledge from the technical track (CLI, Python, and SQL) and be using [cloud] platform and services. Additional changes to project scope is dependent on the student's technical skills and knowledge to explore other topics.

**Goals**: 
- Create and work with software development and automation tools.
- Configure IAM and access control.
- Launch compute resources.
- Manage a network and its resources.
- Host and connect to a web application from a public IP address.
- Analyze application metrics and calculate the cost for running on the cloud.

**Milestones:**
- Module A - Create a program and leverage automation.
- Module B - Successfully host a web server on the cloud.
- Module C - Maintaining and modifying existing resources.

**Deliverables:**
- Successful implementation of web server that directs traffic properly via load balancer.
- Update and maintain the main web server and database that details OCP's cohort information.
