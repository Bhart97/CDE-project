## Project name: CDE Project

**Introduction**: This project will showcase the student's understanding of cloud technology and engineering in preparation for their assignment in health IT. Students will be able to collaborate with their team members and gain additional insight into software development and deployment.

**Description**: Students will demostrate their understanding of these core components: identity and access management, computing services, networking, security, and service analysis. By the end of this project, students will have successfully host and maintain a website connected to a database.

**Constraints**: Completing the project will require basic knowledge from the technical track (CLI, Python, and SQL) and be using [cloud] platform and services. Additional changes to project scope is dependent on the student's technical skills and knowledge to explore other topics.

**Goals**: 
- Create and successfully run a Python script.
- Configure the IAM and access control.
- Launch compute, load balancer, and storage instances.
- Manage a network that is properly configured and secured.
- Host and connect to a web application from the public IP address.
- Use event-driven functions to create automation.
- Analyze application metrics and calculate the cost for running on the cloud.

**Milestones:**
- Module A - Completing their first program.
- Module B - Successfully host an application on the cloud.
- Module C - Maintaining and modifying existing resources.

**Deliverables:**
- Functional, interactive database that contains OCP's cohort information.
- Example: first_name last_name | cohort_no | track | location | profile

**Overview:**
- Create an administrative account and create the domain admin (create users) and network admin (manage network resources)
- Netword admin will manage the network resources and users can use these resources


- Create a main subnet where the real website will be hosted with the latest data
- When practicing, each cohort will have their own subnet with resources that they can create


- Each member will create their own unique script and have a load balancer distribute traffic to backend, if works successfully, the output should be different
