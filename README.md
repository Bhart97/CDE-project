## Project name: CDE Project

**Introduction**: This project was created to provide additional hands-on experience for the cloud engineering technical track in Optimum Hit CareerPath (OCP) program. The objectives are to increase exposure to the basics of programming and software deployment using cloud technology.

**Description**: Students will demostrate their understanding of these core components: identity and access management, computing services, networking, and security. By the end of this project, students should have a better understanding of programming tools and will be able to host a web server on the cloud.

**Constraints**: Completing the project will require basic knowledge from the technical track (Linux command line, Python, cloud computing) and will be using AWS cloud technology. Additional changes to project scope is dependent on the student's technical skills and knowledge to explore other topics.

**Goals**: 
- Create and work with software development and automation tools.
- Configure IAM and access control.
- Launch compute resources.
- Manage a network and its resources.
- Host and connect to a web application from a public IP address.
- Analyze application metrics and calculate the cost for running on the cloud.

**Milestones:**
- Module A - Create a program and leverage automation.
- Module B - Successfully host a web server on the cloud.
- Module C - Maintaining and modifying existing resources.

**Deliverables:**
- Successful implementation of a web server with traffic distribution using a load balancer.
- Update and maintain the main web server and database that details OCP's cohort information.
