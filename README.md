## Project name: CDE Project

**Introduction**: This project will showcase the student's understanding of cloud technology and engineering in preparation for their assignment in health IT. Students will collaborate with their team members and gain additional insight into software development and deployment.

**Description**: Students will host a web application on the cloud and demostrate their understanding of these core components: cloud computing, storage and database management, virtual networks, security, and cost analysis.

**Constraints**: Completing the project will require basic knowledge from the technical track (CLI, Python, and SQL) and will take advantage of the AWS platform's Will low-cost / free cloud technology. Additional changes to project scope is dependent on the student's technical skills to explore other topics.

**Goals**: 
- Create and successfully run a Python script.
- Manage the IAM and access control.
- Launch and configure EC2 instances and storage.
- Configure a VPC to manage both public and private subnets and other security options.
- Host and connect to a web application from the public IP address.
- Use serverless functions to automatically notify of changes to the application.
- Identify potential issues and troubleshoot your deployment.
- Analyze application metrics and calculate the cost for running on the cloud.

**Milestones:**
- Module A - Completing their first program.
- Module B - Successfully host an application on the cloud.
- Module C - Maintaining and automating their application.

**Deliverables:**
- Functional, interactive database that contains OCP's cohort information and allows for queries by the end of 2021.

**TODO:**
