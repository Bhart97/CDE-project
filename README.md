## Project name: CDE Project

**Introduction:** The CDE project's main purpose is to provide additional technical training for the cloud engineering and related tracks for OptimumHIT CareerPath (OCP) training program. However, it is also designed to be a shared respostiory where students can contribute additional content or showcase what they have been learning. Here, students will be able to create resources that can be used by future cohort members.

**Description:** The project's objectives is to help introduce students to the popular tools used for software development and how operations are performed in the cloud. Students will be using programming tools to create a basic website and deploy it within the cloud. By doing so, they will become more familiar with software development along with the core components of cloud computing including: identity and access management, computing and storage resources, networking, and security.

**Constraints:** Basic knowledge gained from the technical track is required (Linux CLI, Python, and cloud concepts). Students who have more technical experiences are encouraged to take advantage of the provided resources and contribute to the development of this ongoing project.

**Goals:** 
- Create and work with software development and automation tools.
- Understand how IAM allows and restricts access.
- Launch and manage cloud resources.
- Become familiar with how cloud resources are managed at scale.

**Modules:**
- Module A - Introduction to software development.
- Module B - Introduction to cloud operations.
- Module C - Maintaining and modifying existing resources.
