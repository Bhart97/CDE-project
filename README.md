# CDE-project
## Project name: CDE Project

**Description**: Project to demostrate understanding of cloud engineering by hosting a [web application] on the cloud. Components include: cloud computing, storage and database management, virtual networks, security, and cost analysis. 

**Scope**: Project will be completed using free tier / low-cost services on AWS and will leverage open-source programs (Git, etc.) to complete this project. Assumes basic knowledge from technical track including command-line tools, Python, and SQL.

**Goals**: 
- Create and successfully run a program
- Launch and configure EC2 instance and MySQL database.
- Create a VPC that allows communication between two subnets.
- Host and connect to a web application from the public IP address.
- Diagnose and analyze the metrics of running applications on the cloud.
- Use serverless functions to automatically notify of changes to the application.

## Instruction

**Introduction - Hello, World!:**
- In this section, you will create a simple Python script that will ask for your name and says hello back.
1.
- (Option a) Open a session on your prefer Linux terminal and select any directory. Create a new directory called "CDE-project" (hint: "makedir <dir_name>") and then run the following command in /CDE-project: 
```
git init.
```
This will create an empty Git repository where all your documents will be stored. Create a new python file called "hello.py".

- (Option b) Install Git Bash. Git Bash is solution for students how do not readily have Linux to access git commands. 

2. Create a new Python file called "hello.py" (hint: "touch <file_name.py>) and use your favorite text editor to open it. Create a script that will ask for your name, receive an input, and then prints "Hello, <name>".

3. Run your program! (Option a) run "python3 hello.py" through the Linux terminal OR (Option b) run "python hello.py" through command prompt (hint: if your code does not run, make sure it is in your PATH).

4. Through either the Linux / Git terminal, run the command "git add hello.py" which will prepare your repo for its first commit. Followed by command git commit -m "My first commit". This will create a local copy of the changes that you have made. The command "git push origin" will save these changes and will reflected on the primary branch.
